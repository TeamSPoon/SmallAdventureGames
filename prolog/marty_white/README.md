Marty's Interactive Fiction Engine in Prolog

Here is a prototype text adventure that I wrote in Prolog back in 2002-2004: 
prolog code files (uses SWI-Prolog, licensed under the GNU GPL V3)

In writing it, my first objective was to create a non-player character inside an adventure game that could do goal solving. 
I also was considering issues of how to design the simulation such that both human players and NPCs could interact with the 
simulation on equal footing: To that end, all outputs from the simulation are bi-lingual messages, marked-up-English and Logic.

I never got the goal solver entirely debugged, and have since found much more efficient algorithms. Prolog is such a one-trick horse, 
I've since switched to using inference engines inside other more multifaceted languages.
